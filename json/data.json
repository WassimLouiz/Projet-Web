            {"firstverse":"Hi there, do you remember me? I've been living in your mind G Fucking it up since you were a kid see I water the seeds I plant of anxiety Don't worry I got a variety I took care of them till they spread entirely That's why you are fucked up mentally It's my doing but you didn't even try to stop me It's your fault too, feeling guilty? I was popping off with my rhyme schemes But you turned the switch off on me You stole away the crown from me And you dropped the pen down too, really? you rather sit there looking at your split palm You spend your day watching the same sitcome And you expect me to stay there and sit calm? Let's go for another run, put your hand on my sweet palm Just tell me and be honest What it the down side of having me? i'm flawless Depression, suicide thoughts, misery, desire to demolish That's a fucking party and it's lawless You should be thanking me, i made you reveal your real skin and I got you rhyming like hop sin Come on, let me hop back in Let's go for another crazy spin You will only add one other sin I promise, it won't be another gin We will rock this shit together We will pop off Let me iiiiiiiiiiin"},
            {"secondverse":"Wait, let's be serious for a second Your mind is already reckoned You thought you could rap Hahaha you must be kidding me, You call this crap A RAP You can't even make a hook you will snap I've been boxing you and waiting for your comeback but i never got a punch back It's like hitting a boxing bag No wonder they all think you are wack We were like superman, until you brought the cryptonite Well guess what man, you ll be at your crypt tonight You had your pen, you had a chance to fight But in your sorrow you are stuck and rather stay off sight reminiscing about the past while on the roof watching the moonlight thinking of a new way to rewrite it and make everything alright i guess now you have an idea of how it is like living in the cold depression !? you can catch it like a common cold stop looking for freaking empathy you should forget about it and about the apology leave everything behind go 90 on the freeway take your mind off from this shit and get a little high today"},
            {"thirdverse":"i got an idea ! it will make your mind finally settle but let me warn you ! you need to be as strong as a metal you got this red button in you and i'm gonna press it it will make you do crazy things but it's worth it you got this problem and you should solve it before it drags you to the bottom cause if you don't resolve it it will evolve to one big problem and eat your ass alive i will tell you the plan but first we need to stop before we arrive you remember that battle of gin that we talked about you are gonna need it to go through the doubt if i was you would i need it ? Y-E-S hell, if you get 2 bottles it might be best for this we gonna also need a shevel and gun maybe a bottle of zenex just for fun it will calm you down if the liquor didn't do the trick you can't get sick or this won't be quick"}
